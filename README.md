# Huffman-Coding
Data Structures Assignment: _Trees Based Project_

Implement a form of data compression; Algorithm to build the Huffman Tree

---------------

Files Implemented: _HuffmanCoding/src/huffman/HuffmanCoding.java_

makeSortedList()
makeTree()
makeEncodings()
encode()
decode()

to compile: javac -d bin src/huffman/*.java

to execute: java -cp bin huffman.Driver

---------------
Programming Skills Utilized: _only mentioning new skills NOT mentioned in previous methods_

makeSortedList()
  - File Reading
  - Object Creation
  - Frequency Calculation
  - Data Structures
  - Sorting
  - Logic & Algorithm Deisgn
  - Character Operations: StdIn.hasNextChar(), StdIn.readChar()

makeTree()
  - concept of Huffman Coding; create Huffman Coding tree nodes; algorthimic understanding
  - Understanding Tree Node Class
  - Linked Lists
  - Queue Class
  - Pointers/References
  - Tree Manipulation

makeEncodings()
  - String Manipulation
  - Array Manipulation
  - Character Encoding: convert char object to its corresponding ASCII code by casting to int
  - Conditional Statements
  - Tree Traversal: depth-first search(DFS); breath-first search(BFS)

encode()
  - File Handling: opening, reading, writing data files; using file objects or stream handlers
  - Understanding of Fileneams
  - Method Utilization
  - Manipulating & Writing encoded data

decode()
  - Output Handling
